We will need:
Condition object w/
Initial x
Initial y
g (acceleration from gravity)
Mass of ping pong ball
Diameter of ping pong ball
Air density (rho)
C_d (drag coefficient)
Launch angle
Initial velocity

Functions:
make_system(condition) -> creates a system with the given condition that contains all of the initial values
slope_func (state, t, system) -> this takes in the current position and velocity of the ping pong ball and returns a new velocity and position for the ping pong ball based off the FBD
run_odeint(system, slope_func) -> this is a black box
